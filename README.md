## Motivation

[copier](https://copier.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is one of my favorite prject scaffold tools, but I was having an hard time remembering the names of my templates and the full command to run copier with any of these templates.

That¬¥s when this tool was born. `copier-run` fetches all the copier templates from my GitHub account (repostiories that contain the topic `copier-template`), and provides a list, where I can easily execute any of my templates.
